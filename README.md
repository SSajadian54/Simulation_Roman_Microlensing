# Simulation_Roman_Microlensing


I have done several simulations about different kinds of microlensing events detectable by the Roman telescope. They are about detecting black holes, 
protoplanetary disks, habitable exoplanets in Roman survey from the Galactic bulge.  

For detecting other astrophysical sources, one should change some parts of codes, e.g., the mass range of the lens, the range of the mass ratio of binary lenses, etc.  

Some pre-made files are read by codes. The code for making extinction files can be found in the 'microlensing_LSST' repository.  
Photometry files can be shared on request.  In that case, please contact me:  sedighe.sajadian@gmail.com

If you use these codes for your academic publications, please cite  the following papers:
